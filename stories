Astronauts are in space trying to extract a substance from mars, but among them there are 2 imposters trying to sabotage them all.
While orange was going to the reactor to complete tasks he saw oranges dead body right there, with red jumping through the vent which none of the crewmates had access to.
Orange ran through all the rooms running to press the button to get all crew members together, to tell them what he saw. Will they belive him or not?
